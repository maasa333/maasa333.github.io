Greetings, Flatiron Community (or anyone else who may be reading this)!  I'm Maasa, and this is the introduction to my epic coding journey...

It started with a Facebook ad!  Not so exciting, I know.  

To be perfectly honest, I did not grow up with a burning desire to build websites, applications or anything like that.  Coding classes were nonexistent throughout my school years, so I did not have much exposure to this world early on.  The closest I got was probably when I created my own Xanga and MySpace pages during those ancient times (ah, so nostalgic...).  Although I was surrounded by a bunch of computer savvy friends in high school, I did not pick up on much because, well, I never really asked.  I knew the basics of navigating through a computer and the internet, so I didn't think it necessary to delve much deeper than that.

Now, back to that Facebook ad.  It was actually an ad for a different school, not Flatiron, opening with something along the lines of, "ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR JOB?  DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR CAREER?"  Yup, that definitely caught my attention.  Having worked as a legal assistant for over 10 years, I had been *yearning* for change.  As I began looking into web development, I found myself becoming more and more interested and excited about it, so I finally took a stab at it through various free online resources and downloaded a few different coding apps on my phone (I am amazed and utterly grateful for how much is available out there to teach yourself).

This was the first time in my life I experienced something extremely challenging, fun and rewarding, all together!  Not only that, but this is highly relevant and useful for today's world.  By learning these skills, I could actually achieve my dream of working in a meaningful capacity where creativity is welcome, and coming up with solutions to help make a positive impact on the world is part of the job. 

Despite all that excitement, I didn't jump right into the decision to officially join any school or program.  There was still fear inside me that this would just end up being another failed attempt.  I did not believe in myself.  Even after I had that initial phone call with a Flatiron representative, the doubtful voices in my head continued to nag. 

It was ultimately my boyfriend who helped me take the leap.  He looked at me seriously, and told me that he believed I **could** do this, and that I **should**.  He said it with such conviction that it kind of surprised me.  That was all I needed though.  Since that moment, I have been believing in myself more and more, little by little. 

So here I am now, at 31, going from salary to part-time at my job while still supporting my son and fur-babies, sacrificing leisure time of hanging out with friends, doing my hobbies less frequently, and spending a pretty big chunk of money to work hard on acquiring this new skill, because **I believe I can do this**, and **I will** use my new skills to help positively impact whoever and whatever I am able to.
