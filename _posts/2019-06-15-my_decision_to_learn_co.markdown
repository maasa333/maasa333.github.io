Greetings, Flatiron Community (or anyone else who may be reading this)!  I'm Maasa, and this is the introduction to my epic coding journey...

It started with a Facebook ad!  Not so exciting, I know.  

To be perfectly honest, I did not grow up with a burning desire to build websites, applications or anything like that.  Coding classes were nonexistent throughout my school years, so I did not have much exposure to this world early on.  The closest I got was probably when I created my own Xanga and MySpace pages during those ancient times (ah, so nostalgic...).  Although I was surrounded by a bunch of computer savvy friends in high school, I did not pick up on much because, well, I never really asked.  I knew the basics of navigating my way around a computer and the internet, so I didn't think it necessary to delve much deeper than that.

Now, back to that Facebook ad.  It was actually an ad for a different school, not for Flatiron, opening with something along the lines of, "ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR JOB?  DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR CAREER?"  Yup, that definitely caught my attention.  Having worked as a legal assistant for over 10 years, I had been *yearning* for change.  So, I started doing what most people do these days when they want to learn more about something:  good ol' Google searching.  As I began looking into web development, I found myself becoming more and more interested in this world that I had been around for so long yet knew nothing about as far as what was going on behind the scenes, so I finally took a stab at it through various free online resources and downloaded a few different coding apps on my phone (I am amazed and utterly grateful for how much is available out there to teach yourself).

This was the first time in my life I experienced an actual desire to learn an extremely challenging skill that not only was tough, but also fun and rewarding!  On top of that, the fact that it is highly relevant and useful for today's world made me eager to further educate myself.  If I could develop programming skills, I knew that it could be a huge step towards actualizing my dream of working in a meaningful capacity where creativity is welcome and coming up with solutions to help make a positive impact on the world would be part of the job. 

Despite all that excitement, I didn't jump right into the decision to officially join any school or program.  There was still fear inside me that this would just end up being another failed attempt.  I did not believe in myself.  Even after I had that initial phone call with a Flatiron representative, the doubtful voices in my head continued to nag. 

It was ultimately my boyfriend who helped me take the leap.  He looked at me seriously, and told me that he believed I **could** do this, and that I **should**.  He said it with such conviction that it kind of surprised me.  But that was the push I needed.  After receiving that encouragement, I proceeded to become an official Flatiron student and have been keeping at the hard work, because I know that in the end it will turn out to be the most rewarding accomplishments ever for me.

So here I am now, at 31, going from salary to part-time at my job while still supporting my son and fur-babies, sacrificing leisure time of hanging out with friends, doing my hobbies much less frequently, and spending a pretty big chunk of money to gain this new skill, because **I believe I can do this**!  The work will be grueling and stressful, no doubt.  I'm sure there will be times when I question this huge decision I've made, but quitting is not an option.  I have finally found a path towards a better future that feels right, and I am determined to succeed.
