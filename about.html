<p>Maasa Kono is a Flatiron student who, along with studying, juggles parenting, caring for five fur-babies, and work as a legal assistant.  Music, dance and visual art are some of the things she finds most pleasurable, but her true longing has been to find a means to create a positive impact in the world, to bring more joy and wellness all around.  She found that gaining the ability to create tools others can use for their own well-being was not only sensible, but also fun!</p>
